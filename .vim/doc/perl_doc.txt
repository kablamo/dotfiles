		PERLDOC PLUGIN REFERENCE by Colin Keith

==============================================================================
1. Plugin information						*perldoc-info*

The Perldoc.vim plugin is a command + function that enables the perldoc
command to be used from within the Vim text editor. This can be useful for
Perl coders as it enables them to be able to work with a Perl program
whilst having the corresponding documentation open in front of them at the
same time.

When activated the Perldoc command opens a new window at the top of the
screen and places the output of the perldoc command into that window. This
read-only window is just a Vim window, so you can perform all of the normal
commands that you can in Vim - such as searching for a word or expression,
yanking examples and code snippets.


==============================================================================
2. Perldoc Commands				*perldoc-commands* *Perldoc*

 :Perldoc [{perldoc page}]
         Open the specified POD documentation in a new window. If no
 argument is specified, the function scans the line that the cursor is on
 for an appropriate module loading function such as 'use' or 'require'.
 (|perldoc-matches|)


==============================================================================
3. Perldoc Variables					*perldoc-variables*

 |iskeyword|  - a-z,A-Z,48-57,:,/,.
                The . and / were missing from the system ftplugin version.

 |keywordprg| - This is given a default value of 'perldoc'. The first time
                that the Perldoc command is used successfully, 'keywordprg'
                is updated to have the value of the perldoc program that
                was used whether this was |g:perldoc_program| or a default
                location for the perldoc command,

 |g:perldoc_program|			*g:perldoc_program* *perldoc_program*
              - This variable is used to define the location of your
                perldoc command. It defaults to either:

                  /usr/local/bin/perldoc

                or for Windows users:

                  c:/perl/bin/perldoc.bat

                This variables is only used by this program however, so you
                may wish to reduce the amount of in memory clutter by
                wrapping it within an FileType autocmd (|:autocmd|):

                  au FileType perl let g:perldoc_program='/usr/bin/perldoc'

 |g:perldoc_flags|			*g:perldoc_flags* *perldoc_flags*
              - This variable is used to define whether you should use the
                -U switch when executing the perldoc program. This flag is
                only available in Perl v5.6 and above, so older versions of
                Perldoc cannot use it. This means that you cannot use this
                program without errors as a root user on a Unix system with
                older versions of Perl. If you do have to do this, then you
                can set this flag to a value of 'su' followed by the user
                name you want to switch to to read man pages. By default
                this is user 'nobody', but you can specify others by setting

                     let g:perldoc_flags = "su colin"

                 This cannot be a super user or Perldoc will refuse to run.

==============================================================================
4. Perldoc Matches					*perldoc-matches*
 Perldoc will match the following patterns:

 <args>            - Matches exactly as entered.
 use <match>       - Matches anything after the use that is a valid module
                     name. This includes ::'s so NET::FTP will work.
 require '<match>'
 require "<match>" - Matches anything inside the quotation marks that are
                     valid filenames, include .pm and /'s  /'s are
                     converted to :: and '.pm' is stripped. Thus if you
                     match on require 'Net/FTP.pm' it will be passed as

                      :!perldoc Net::FTP
